  - Needs: Video processor, Audio processor, Stream manager, Codec manager

- üìÅ **Platform Package** (`packages/platform/`):
  - Package structure created  
  - Needs: Windows/macOS/Linux capture services, Input injection

### üîÑ Next Steps (Continuing from Roadmap)

#### Immediate Next Actions (Current Phase 2.2):

1. **Complete Media Processing Pipeline** (Week 10-14):
   ```typescript
   // Implement these in packages/media/src/
   - video-processor.ts     // Frame encoding/decoding, motion detection
   - audio-processor.ts     // Audio processing, sync with video
   - stream-manager.ts      // Media stream coordination
   - codec-manager.ts       // Codec selection and optimization
   - types.ts              // Media-related interfaces
   ```

2. **Implement Platform-Specific Capture** (Week 9-12):
   ```typescript
   // Implement these in packages/platform/src/
   - capture-service.ts     // Cross-platform screen capture interface
   - input-service.ts       // Mouse/keyboard input injection
   - platform-factory.ts   // Platform detection and service creation
   - windows-capture.ts     // Windows-specific implementation
   - macos-capture.ts       // macOS-specific implementation  
   - linux-capture.ts       // Linux-specific implementation
   - types.ts              // Platform-related interfaces
   ```

3. **Create Missing Signaling Service Components**:
   ```typescript
   // Implement these in apps/signaling-server/src/
   - services/signaling.service.ts  // WebRTC signaling logic
   - services/peer.service.ts       // Peer discovery and management
   - services/room.service.ts       // Room/session management
   - middleware/auth.middleware.ts  // Socket authentication
   - config/config.ts              // Server configuration
   ```

#### Phase 3: User Interface & Experience (Months 3-5)
- **UI Components Library** (`packages/ui-components/`)
- **Desktop Client** (`apps/desktop-client/`) - Electron app
- **Mobile Client** (`apps/mobile-client/`) - React Native app  
- **Web Client** (`apps/web-client/`) - Progressive Web App

#### Phase 4: Infrastructure & Deployment (Months 4-6)
- **Docker containerization** for all services
- **Kubernetes orchestration** manifests
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform)
- **CI/CD pipelines** setup

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Status

#### Ready to Use:
- ‚úÖ Monorepo structure with workspace dependencies
- ‚úÖ TypeScript configuration across all packages
- ‚úÖ Build scripts for packages and apps
- ‚úÖ Testing framework setup (Jest)
- ‚úÖ Linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier)

#### Available Commands:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev:auth           # Start auth service in dev mode
npm run dev:signaling      # Start signaling server in dev mode
npm run start:services     # Start both services concurrently

# Building
npm run build:packages     # Build all packages
npm run build:apps         # Build all applications
npm run build              # Build everything

# Testing & Quality
npm run test               # Run all tests
npm run lint               # Check code quality
npm run format             # Format code
```

### üéØ Current Development Focus

**You are currently at the beginning of Phase 2.2 (Week 9-12) - Platform-Specific Capture Implementation.**

The authentication system is complete and the signaling server framework is ready. The next major milestone is implementing the core media capture and processing capabilities that will enable actual remote desktop functionality.

### üìã Recommended Continuation Steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   cd d:\coding_env\multi\remote
   npm install
   ```

2. **Implement Media Types** (Start here):
   ```typescript
   // packages/media/src/types.ts
   // Define interfaces for FrameData, AudioData, EncodingSettings, etc.
   ```

3. **Implement Video Processor**:
   ```typescript
   // packages/media/src/video-processor.ts  
   // Core video encoding/decoding functionality
   ```

4. **Implement Platform Capture Services**:
   ```typescript
   // packages/platform/src/capture-service.ts
   // Abstract interface for screen capture
   ```

This approach maintains the systematic development following your original roadmap while building upon the solid foundation that's already been established.
